# Plan 07-03: Dialog/sheet/card entrance animations and analytics chart transitions

## Status: DONE

## Steps
1. [x] Add staggered entrance to habits-list.tsx (wrapping SortableHabitCard items, preserving dnd-kit)
2. [x] Update analytics-client.tsx with staggered entrance animations
3. [x] Update streak-display.tsx (OverallStatsCards) with staggered fade-in
4. [x] Update trend-chart.tsx with fade-in animation
5. [x] Update habit-comparison.tsx with staggered entrance animations
6. [x] Update day-of-week-chart.tsx with fade-in animation
7. [x] Ensure all animations have reduced-motion fallback (useReducedMotion check in every component)
