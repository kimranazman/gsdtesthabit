# Plan 03-01: Dashboard page with today's habit checklist

## Goal
Build the dashboard query and server component page that displays today's applicable habits as a checklist with efficient batched queries.

## Tasks
1. Add `getTodaysHabitsWithCompletions()` query to `src/lib/db/queries.ts`
   - Single query that joins habits with completions for today's date
   - Filter: only active (non-archived) habits
   - Frequency-aware filtering: daily = every day, weekly = any day (check if completed this week), custom = on specified days (check today's day-of-week)
   - Returns habit data + completion status + notes in one query
2. Update dashboard page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to fetch and display today's habits
3. Create `DashboardClient` component for interactive checklist

## Files
- `src/lib/db/queries.ts` - Add batched query
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Server component with data fetching
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx` - Client component wrapper

## Verification
- Dashboard loads with today's applicable habits
- No N+1 queries (single batched query)
- Frequency filtering works correctly
