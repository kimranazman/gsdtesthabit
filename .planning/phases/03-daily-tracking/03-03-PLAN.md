# Plan 03-03: Completion notes and visual state styling

## Goal
Add optional notes per completion and visually distinguish completed, pending, and missed habits.

## Tasks
1. Add notes dialog/popover to each habit check item
   - Small text input that appears on click
   - Saves via `updateCompletionNotes` server action
   - Shows existing notes if present
2. Visual distinction styling:
   - **Completed**: Green check, strikethrough text, muted background, subtle green border
   - **Pending**: Default styling, empty checkbox, full opacity
   - **Missed**: Warning styling (only relevant if we show past-due items, but for today's view "pending" and "missed" are effectively the same - pending items that haven't been done yet)
3. Progress summary at top showing X/Y completed today

## Files
- `src/components/dashboard/habit-check-item.tsx` - Enhanced with notes + visual states
- `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx` - Progress summary

## Verification
- User can add and edit notes on completed habits
- Completed habits look visually distinct from pending
- Progress counter updates correctly
